# Decision Log

A record of key architectural and technical decisions made during development.

---

## 001 - Use Isolation Forest for anomaly detection (not supervised learning)

**Date:** 2026-04-23
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:**
The system starts with no labeled fault data. We cannot use a supervised classifier (e.g. Random Forest, SVM) without a dataset of labeled normal/fault readings.

**Decision:**
Use Isolation Forest from scikit-learn. It is an unsupervised algorithm that learns what "normal" looks like and flags readings that deviate from it.

**Consequences:**

- Can train immediately once 1-2 weeks of normal data is collected
- No manual labeling required
- Phase 3 upgrade path: LSTM on labeled historical data once faults have been observed and logged

## 002 - Device authentication via API key, not JWT

**Date:** 2026-04-23
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:**
ESP32 firmware cannot easily manage JWT refresh cycles. JWTs expire and require re-authentication logic that is complex to implement reliably on embedded hardware.

**Decision:**
Devices authenticate using a static `X-API-Key` header. Keys are generated on device registration and stored hashed in the database.

**Consequences:**

- Simple firmware implementation - set once in config.h
- API keys are long-lived - rotation must be done manually via admin panel
- Keys should be kept out of firmware binaries in production (use NVS on ESP32)

---

## 003 - Monorepo structure (firmware + backend + frontend in one repo)

**Date:** 2026-04-23
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:**
Three layers (firmware, backend, frontend) could each be separate repos. For a portfolio project, monorepo makes it easier to demonstrate the full system in one place.

**Decision:**
Single GitHub repo with `firmware/`, `backend/`, `frontend/` directories.

**Consequences:**

- Simpler for reviewers to navigate
- Docker Compose at root ties all services together
- Each layer still has its own Dockerfile and can be deployed independently

---

## 004 - Poll-based frontend updates (not WebSocket)

**Date:** 2026-04-23
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:**
Real-time WebSocket connections would give instant dashboard updates but add complexity to the backend and deployment.

**Decision:**
Frontend polls `GET /api/v1/telemetry/{device_id}/latest` every 5 seconds. Sensors post every 5 seconds, so polling interval matches ingest rate.

**Consequences:**

- Simpler to implement and deploy
- 5-second polling is acceptable given the 5-second sensor cycle
- Phase 3 upgrade: replace with Server-Sent Events or WebSocket if lower latency is needed

---

## 005 - PostgreSQL over SQLite for development

**Date:** 2026-04-23
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:**
SQLite would be simpler for local development but would require schema changes when deploying to Render/PostgreSQL.

**Decision:**
Use PostgreSQL locally via Docker Compose from Day 1. Same database in dev and production.

**Consequences:**

- Dev/prod parity from the start
- Requires Docker running locally
- UUID primary keys, `gen_random_uuid()` and `TIMESTAMP` types all behave the same in both environments

---

## 006 - APScheduler (in-process) over Celery for background tasks

**Date:** 2026-06-01
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:**
The project needs two background tasks: demo mode telemetry generation (every 5 seconds) and telemetry data retention (daily at 02:00 UTC). Celery would be the production-grade choice but requires a Redis broker and separate worker process.

**Decision:**
Use APScheduler's BackgroundScheduler running in a daemon thread inside the same FastAPI process. Both tasks use their own SQLAlchemy sessions rather than the request-scoped Depends(get_db) session.

**Consequences:**

- Zero extra infrastructure (no Celery worker, no separate broker config)
- Tasks are lost if the process crashes mid-run (acceptable for demo and retention)
- Cannot distribute tasks across workers - one instance runs each job (fine for single-instance Render deployment)
- Upgrade path: swap to Celery when horizontal scaling or task persistence is required

---

## 007 - StreamingResponse for CSV export (not pre-built file)

**Date:** 2026-06-01
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:**
Telemetry exports can be large. Loading all rows into a Python list before sending them would spike memory usage.

**Decision:**
Use FastAPI's `StreamingResponse` with an `io.StringIO` buffer and Python's `csv` stdlib. Rows are serialised in one pass and the buffer is iterated directly into the HTTP response.

**Consequences:**

- Memory usage is bounded regardless of result set size
- Buffered in `io.StringIO` rather than streamed row-by-row (acceptable for current scale; could switch to a generator per row for very large exports)

---

## 008 - TelemetryChart owns its own data fetch (not parent-controlled)

**Date:** 2026-06-01
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:**
The previous design passed `readings: Telemetry[]` as a prop. The chart now has its own time-range picker (1h/6h/24h/7d) which changes what data is fetched.

**Decision:**
Pass `deviceId: string` to TelemetryChart and let it own the `useTelemetry` call internally. The parent no longer manages the readings array.

**Consequences:**

- Time-range changes do not require the parent page to re-render
- The chart can be placed on any page (dashboard, compare, device detail) with one prop
- Slight duplication: device detail page also calls useTelemetry separately for the live sensor grid

---

## 009 - Tailwind class-based dark mode (not media query)

**Date:** 2026-06-01
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:**
The app is dark-only. Adding a light mode toggle was requested. Tailwind supports two dark mode strategies: `media` (follows OS setting) and `class` (controlled by a CSS class on `<html>`).

**Decision:**
Use `darkMode: 'class'` with a pre-hydration inline script in `<head>` that reads `localStorage` and applies the `dark` class before React mounts. This prevents a flash of the wrong theme.

**Consequences:**

- User preference overrides OS setting (intentional - dashboard use case needs explicit control)
- Inline script is `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` but is safe here as it contains no user input

---

## 010 - WebSocket JWT auth via query parameter (not header)

**Date:** 2026-06-01
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:**
The telemetry WebSocket endpoint needed authentication. The WebSocket handshake is a plain HTTP upgrade request, but browser WebSocket APIs do not allow setting custom headers (unlike fetch/XHR).

**Decision:**
Pass the JWT as a `?token=` query parameter. The server validates the token before calling `websocket.accept()` and closes with code 1008 (Policy Violation) on auth failure. The client must not retry on 1008 to avoid looping forever on an expired token.

**Consequences:**

- Token appears in server access logs. Acceptable for an internal maintenance tool where logs are admin-only
- The alternative (httpOnly cookie) does not work for cross-origin WebSocket connections in all browsers

---

## 011 - ML retrain as in-process background task (not a queue worker)

**Date:** 2026-06-02
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:**
The ML retrain endpoint needs to fit an IsolationForest on up to 10,000 rows. This takes a few seconds - too long to block the HTTP response. Several options exist: a Celery/RQ task queue, a subprocess, or FastAPI's built-in BackgroundTasks.

**Decision:**
Use FastAPI BackgroundTasks. The task runs in the same process after the 202 response is sent. A 1-hour in-memory cooldown prevents concurrent runs. The model is written to disk and the in-memory reference reloaded atomically via reload_model().

**Consequences:**

- No extra infrastructure (no Redis queue, no Celery worker). Acceptable for a single-worker deployment
- If the process dies mid-retrain, the old model.pkl remains intact so scoring continues with the previous model
- The cooldown resets on restart - this is acceptable; an admin can immediately trigger a retrain after a restart

---

## 012 - Pagination via skip/limit (not cursor-based)

**Date:** 2026-06-02
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:**
Tickets and devices pages needed pagination to avoid loading unbounded result sets. Two common approaches: offset/limit (simple) and cursor-based (consistent across concurrent mutations).

**Decision:**
Use `skip` and `limit` query params. The frontend uses page state and disables Next when fewer than `PAGE_SIZE` rows are returned, signalling the last page.

**Consequences:**

- Simpler to implement and reason about
- Page boundaries can shift if rows are inserted or deleted between requests. Acceptable for a maintenance tool where exact page consistency is not critical

---

## 013 - Self-hosted Docker Compose on a single VPS (not managed cloud services)

**Date:** 2026-06-02
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:**
Cloud-managed services (Supabase, Neon, Railway, PlanetScale) were evaluated as replacements for the self-hosted Postgres and Redis containers. The question was whether splitting the stack across multiple managed providers would reduce cost or operational burden.

**Decision:**
Keep the entire stack (Postgres, Redis, FastAPI, Next.js) in a single Docker Compose deployment on one Hetzner CX21 or DigitalOcean Basic Droplet (~$4-6/month). The GitHub Student Developer Pack provides $200 of DigitalOcean credit, covering approximately 33 months at $6/month - effectively free for the duration of a university degree.

Managed services are not needed because:

- Docker Compose already runs Postgres and Redis with zero extra cost
- Adding Supabase/Neon would introduce external network latency between services
- It would split the stack across multiple dashboards and connection strings with no benefit
- The free tiers of managed services have row/storage limits that would be hit once real device data accumulates

**Consequences:**

- Total production cost: $0/month while Student Pack credit lasts, then ~$6/month
- Frontend stays on Vercel free tier (separate from the VPS)
- One `docker compose up -d` on the VPS deploys the full backend stack
- Upgrade path: if the project scales beyond one box, extract Postgres to a managed service (Neon or Supabase) at that point - the SQLAlchemy ORM means the change is a one-line `DATABASE_URL` swap

## 014 - Licence: AGPL-3.0 over Apache 2.0 or MIT

**Date:** 2026-06-03
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:**
The project needed a licence before being made public. Three common options were considered: MIT, Apache 2.0, and AGPL-3.0.

**Decision:**
AGPL-3.0.

**Consequences:**

- Apache 2.0 allows anyone to fork, rebrand and run the software as a commercial network service without publishing their changes. AGPL-3.0 closes this loophole: anyone running a modified version as a network service must publish the source under the same terms.
- MIT has no such protection - a company could silently ship Phaemos as a product with no attribution requirement.
- AGPL-3.0 requires copyright notices to remain intact and changes to be published, preventing the project from being claimed by someone else.
- Contributors must be informed that their work will be released under AGPL-3.0 - this is stated in CONTRIBUTING.md.

## 015 - Backend hosting: DigitalOcean VPS over Render

**Date:** 2026-06-03
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:**
The original deployment target was Render's free tier. Render discontinued its free tier for web services, requiring a migration.

**Decision:**
DigitalOcean VPS with Docker Compose + Nginx reverse proxy.

**Consequences:**

- A $6/month DigitalOcean droplet (covered by GitHub Student Pack credit) gives full root access, no cold-start latency and predictable costs.
- Docker Compose on the VPS mirrors the local dev environment exactly - same `docker-compose.yml`, same env vars.
- Nginx handles SSL termination (Certbot), reverse proxy to the FastAPI container, and sets `X-Real-IP` so rate limiting works correctly.
- No vendor lock-in: the Docker Compose stack is portable to any VPS provider.

---

## 016 - Status monitoring: Instatus over Uptime Kuma

**Date:** 2026-06-03
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:**
The project needed a public status page. Uptime Kuma (self-hosted) was the initial candidate.

**Decision:**
Instatus hosted SaaS at status.phaemos.com.

**Consequences:**

- Uptime Kuma would run on the same VPS as the application it monitors. If the VPS goes down, both the app and its monitor go offline at the same time, making the status page unreachable precisely when users need it most.
- Instatus is hosted independently on its own infrastructure. A full VPS outage does not take the status page down.
- Instatus provides a CNAME-based custom domain, subscriber notifications and a clean incident history view with no operational overhead.

## 017 - FFT library: CMSIS-DSP arm_rfft_fast_f32 over custom DFT

**Date:** 2026-06-03
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:**
The STM32 vibration node used a naive O(N^2) DFT implemented from scratch. A TODO in fft.h noted CMSIS-DSP as the upgrade path once the CubeIDE build was finalised.

**Decision:**
Migrate to `arm_rfft_fast_f32` from the CMSIS-DSP library.

**Consequences:**

- The custom DFT was O(N^2): approximately 16,400 cycles (~171 us) on a 96 MHz Cortex-M4F for N=128.
- CMSIS-DSP gives O(N log N): approximately 1,800 cycles (~19 us) for N=128 - a 9x speedup.
- `arm_rfft_fast_f32` uses the hardware FPU instructions of the Cortex-M4F automatically.
- The library is bundled with STM32CubeIDE so there is no extra dependency to manage.
- Sample buffer expanded from 100 to FFT_SIZE=128 (power-of-two required by the algorithm), giving genuine frequency resolution of 0.78 Hz per bin.

## 018 - Community channel: GitHub Discussions over Issues for questions

**Date:** 2026-06-03
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:**
With the repo made public, a community support channel was needed. GitHub Issues was already in use for bug tracking.

**Decision:**
GitHub Discussions for questions and ideas; GitHub Issues for confirmed bugs and accepted feature work only.

**Consequences:**

- Mixing Q&A and bug tracking in Issues makes triage harder and creates noise for contributors monitoring the issue tracker.
- Discussions has separate categories (General, Ideas, Show and Tell, Bugs) so contributors know where to post without polluting the bug tracker.
- The Bugs discussion category explicitly redirects to Issues once the report is confirmed - the two channels are complementary, not competing.
- CONTRIBUTING.md, SUPPORT.md, README and the FAQ page all direct users to Discussions first.

## 019 - Hardware-blocked work deferred until physical components arrive

**Date:** 2026-06-03
**Status:** Accepted

**Context:**
Several features require real sensor readings that cannot be simulated: Isolation Forest model training (needs 1-2 weeks of genuine fault/normal data), hardware testing across all 4 nodes, and the node enclosure design (needs breadboard prototyping to confirm fitment). These items are tracked in suggestions/README.md (local only, gitignored) and docs/VERIFICATION.md.

**Decision:**
Do not attempt these items until all four physical nodes (ESP32, STM32 Black Pill, Arduino Nano, Raspberry Pi Pico 2W) are assembled and producing real telemetry. No software workaround will substitute for this.

**Blocked items:**

- Custom node enclosure design - after all 4 nodes tested on breadboard; options: 3D print (Aston lab), laser cut acrylic, CNC aluminium
- Hardware testing - full sensor suite on all 4 boards; see hardware/wiring/ for pinouts
- Train Isolation Forest - after 1-2 weeks of real telemetry, run backend/ml/train.py and evaluate with evaluate.py

**Consequences:**

- The ML scoring route already exists and returns a default score of 0.0 until a real model.pkl is present. The system is fully functional without the trained model.
- All firmware code is written and ready; hardware testing is the only remaining gate.
- No code changes are required to unblock these items - the work is purely physical assembly and data collection.
