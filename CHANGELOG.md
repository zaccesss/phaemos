### Added

- WebSocket reconnect with exponential backoff (1/2/4/8/16s, max 5 attempts). No retry on close code 1008 to prevent token-expiry loop (PR 77)
- `useWebSocketTelemetry` hook; `TelemetryChart` now merges live WS pushes with 5s polling and deduplicates by id (PR 77)
- `POST /api/v1/ml/retrain` - admin-only endpoint; fits IsolationForest on last 10,000 rows, dumps model.pkl and reloads in-memory model; 1-hour cooldown; logs outcome to audit log (PR 80)
- `FEATURE_COLS` constant and `reload_model()` in `ml_service.py` so scoring and retraining use the same feature vector (PR 80)
- SensorGrid on device detail page polls `GET /telemetry/{id}/latest` every 5s via `useTelemetry` - live sensor values without a page refresh (PR 81)
- AlertBanner now has a Create Ticket button that opens a modal with TicketForm prefilled from alert context (device_id, title, severity/timestamp in description) (PR 83)
- Pagination on `GET /tickets` and `GET /devices` - `skip`/`limit` query params (default 0/20) (PR 84)
- Prev/Next pagination controls on Tickets and Devices frontend pages (PR 84)
- `docs/security.md` - 18-measure security table (PR 85)
- `Makefile` - make dev, make test, make lint, make build, make migrate, make seed (PR 85)
- `SUPPORT.md` - self-help resources and common issues (PR 85)
- Three new ADRs in `docs/decisions.md`: WS JWT via query param (010), ML retrain as background task (011), skip/limit pagination (012) (PR 85)

### Fixed

- `alerts.resolved` ORM column changed from `Column(String)` to `Column(Boolean)`. `str(resolved)` cast removed from list-alerts filter - DB schema was already BOOLEAN so no migration required (PR 82)
- Alert rule evaluation now receives all v2 sensor fields. The ingest route previously built `reading` from 6 hardcoded fields; rules on `gas_level`, `shaft_rpm` etc. would never fire (PR 79)
- `/ml/score` endpoint fixed to use `payload.model_dump()` instead of same 6-field hardcoded dict (PR 80)
- `.githooks/commit-msg` and `.githooks/prepare-commit-msg` execute bit committed; hooks were silently ignored on fresh clones (PR 78)

## [2.1.0] - 2026-06-01

### Added
- Login page and session guard (backlog - next session)
- Hardware inventory tracking: hardware/inventory/owned.md and needed.md with full component list
- README added to every folder and subfolder across the entire repo
- Pico W schematic placeholder added to hardware/schematics/
- PostCSS config (postcss.config.js) - was missing, causing Tailwind CSS to not compile
- alerts.resolved String/Boolean type mismatch fix in routes/alerts.py
- Dashboard selected-device polling bug fix - user selection no longer resets every 5 seconds

### Changed
- TelemetryChart refactored: prop changed from readings[] to deviceId, now manages own data fetch
- Dashboard uses Promise.allSettled so a failing alerts query never blocks device cards
- layout.tsx: suppressHydrationWarning on html element, proper light/dark body classes
