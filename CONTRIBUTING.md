## Commit Message Format

```
type: short description
```

Subject line must be 72 characters or fewer, written in the imperative mood
(`add` not `added`) with no full stop at the end.

Supported types: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `docs`, `test`, `chore`, `style`,
`perf` and `revert`.

An optional body (separated by a blank line) should explain **why** the change
was made, not how.

## Pull Request Checklist

- Title follows `type: short description`
- Summary section explains what changed and why
- Changes are listed as short bullet points
- Steps to test are included
- Related issue is linked with `closes #NUMBER`

## Code Standards

- All new code must include comments explaining non-obvious logic.
- Use UK English in all prose, comments and variable names
  (e.g. `colour` not `color`, `organisation` not `organization`).
- No Oxford commas in prose.
- No em dashes or en dashes; use hyphens instead.
- Backend: follow PEP 8. Run `ruff check` before committing.
- Frontend: TypeScript strict mode. Run `npm run lint` before committing.
