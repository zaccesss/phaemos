# Contributing

Thank you for taking the time to contribute to PHAEMOS.

## One-time setup

After cloning, activate the git hooks that enforce commit style:

```bash
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
```

This enables:

- `commit-msg` - rejects em/en dashes and Oxford commas in commit messages
- `prepare-commit-msg` - strips AI co-author credits automatically

---

## Workflow

1. Create or pick an issue from the issue tracker.
2. Create a branch from `main` following the naming convention below.
3. Make focused changes with clear commit messages.
4. Update `logs/YYYY-MM-DD.md` with what changed and why (all changes go here).
5. Update `CHANGELOG.md` under `[Unreleased]` for public-facing changes only.
6. Push your branch and open a pull request using the PR template.
7. Wait for CI to pass, then merge.

## Branch Naming

| Prefix                       | When to use            |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| `feat/short-description`     | New capability         |
| `fix/short-description`      | Bug correction         |
| `docs/short-description`     | Documentation only     |
| `refactor/short-description` | Internal restructure   |
| `chore/short-description`    | Tooling or config work |

---

## Commit Message Format

```text
type: short description
```

Subject line must be 72 characters or fewer, written in the imperative mood
(`add` not `added`) with no full stop at the end.

Supported types: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `docs`, `test`, `chore`, `style`,
`perf` and `revert`.

An optional body (separated by a blank line) should explain **why** the change
was made, not how.

---

## Pull Request Checklist

- Title follows `type: short description`
- Summary section explains what changed and why
- Changes are listed as short bullet points
- Steps to test are included
- Related issue is linked with `closes #NUMBER`

---

## Code Standards

- All new code must include comments explaining non-obvious logic.
- **Write all comments in first person.** "I use this to..." not "Uses..." or "This function...".
- Use UK English in all prose, comments and variable names (colour not color, organisation not organization).
- No Oxford commas in prose or commit messages.
- No em dashes or en dashes - use hyphens instead.
- Backend: follow PEP 8. Run `ruff check backend/` before committing.
- Frontend: TypeScript strict mode. Run `npm run lint` before committing.

---

## Logs and changelog

- `logs/YYYY-MM-DD.md` - internal engineering record. Log all changes here, including reasoning and decisions.
- `CHANGELOG.md` - public-facing release notes only. Never put internal session notes in CHANGELOG.md.
- Update the log file as you work, not just at the end of a session.
